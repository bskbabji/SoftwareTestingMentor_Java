Arrays have fixed size where as collections can grow and shrink dynamically
arrays can store primitive data types where as collections can store objects.
to convert primitive data types into objects , we need wrapper classes.
But to store primitive data types in collections as objects , we do not need wrapper classes because 
wrapping is done automatically. But while unwrapping that is storing a collections object in a primitive 
data type variable we need to typecast .

ArrayList and HashSet are widely used collections. ArrayList and HashSet implement collections interface.
HashMap is the wide used Map. HashMap implements Map interface

switch(expression)
{
       case 1: statements;
		break;

	case 2:statements;
		break;
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	default: statements;
		


}

without break statements , every statement after the condition is met gets executed. Like for example if case 2 is matched with the switch expression , 

case 2, case 3, case 4 and so on ........and default all of them will get executes. BUt we do not want that to happen. we want only one of the case to be 

executed and that is where break statement comes to help.

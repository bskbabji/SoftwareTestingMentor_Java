Constructors are used to initialize the data members of an object while its creation.
Constructors have the same name as the class name
Constructors do not have a return type not even void
Constructors should always be public
Constructor overloading is possible

 when ever a statement like

			new <class_name>() 

is encountered a new object is created in memory. 

Whenever an object is created, memory is allocated and a implicit constructor is invoked by the JVM. With implicit constructor, the default values 
are zero or null.

the other types of constructors are 

				no argument constructor
				parameterized constructor

If we define atleast one parameterized constructor, we have to define a no argument default constructor otherwise we will get a run time exception.

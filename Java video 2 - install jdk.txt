Install java and set path and java_home environment variables



go to www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html and install java


java will be installed in c:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.1

if you go to command prompt and type  java -version, if the system recognizes java then no need to add
java (bin folder) path to environment variable path 

otherwise add jdk bin folder path to path environment variable

path    c:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.1\bin

we also have to create a new environment variable JAVA_HOME and set it to c:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.1

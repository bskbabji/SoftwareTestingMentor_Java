In java we have Properties class. 
Along with that we have to use FileReader or FileInputStream.

the properties file should have .properties extension.
properties file contains key=value pairs

we have to create to properties object and we have to load it either with a file reader or file input stream object.
we use getProperty method of Properties class to read 

FileReader is a convenient class to read character files.
Where as fileInputStream class is used to read streams of raw bytes of data.

System.getProperty("user.dir") is useful when we export the project and share with team members they might store the project in a different drive and we
do not want the program to fail as it is not able to find to file. 

System.getProperty("user.dir") helps to provide dynamic path rather than a static file location.

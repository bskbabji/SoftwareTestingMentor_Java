we use FileWriter or FileOutputStream to write to files.

<properties_object>.setProperty("key_name","value");
<properties_object>.store( FileWriter or FileOutputStream object, "comments" or null);
<properties_object>.clear();

when we try to open a file using FileWriter or FileInputStream if we give file_path and true as paramenters, then the file gets created in append mode.

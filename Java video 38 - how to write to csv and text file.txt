We use FileWriter to open the file either in create mode or append mode. we also have to give the file extension when opening the file 
along with filename.
We use BufferedWriter object to which we pass the FileWriter object , which mentions that we are writing to the file.

a text file has .txt extension
a properties file has .properties extension
a csv file has .csv extension

In csv file, the contents of the file are separated by comma. 

for a text file, <BufferedWriter>.write("contents to write into file");
for a csv file, <BufferedWriter>.write("contents to write into file" + ",");

after every write() we need to flush the buffer using the flush() method to push the contents of the buffer to the file.

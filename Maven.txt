Maven is a dependency management and build management tool

As a dependency management tool , eclipse already comes integrated with maven.
By giving dependies in pom.xml file all the necessary jar files are integrated automatically.
Helps the team to maintian consistency that everyone works on the same jar versions.

But to use maven as a build tool, we need to install maven on the machine and then add maven bin folder to path
environment variable and create MVN_HOME variable to point out the maven folder( the parent folder of bin)
to see if maven is installed properly, at command prompt give ( mvn -version ), if the system recognizes the command then maven is 
installed properly. if the system says command not recognized then maven is not installed properly.

In eclipse after we create a maven project, the JRE system library should show the jdk version installed. 
right click on "jre system library" folder that is present in the maven project -> configure build bath and do the necessary changes. 


File->New->Other->Maven->Maven Project 

a maven project does not need a main() function.

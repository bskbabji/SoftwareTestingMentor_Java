Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. ...
 The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an
 existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class.

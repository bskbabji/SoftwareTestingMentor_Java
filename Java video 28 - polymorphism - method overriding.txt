In method overloading the signature of the method is different (like the type of parameters or number of parameters ) based on which the method to invoke 
is chosen.

Where as in Method overriding the signature of the methods is same and how a method is invoked is based upon several conditions.
Method overriding comes in picture when there is inheritance.
like for example, when the functionality provided by the parent class has to be tweaked in a way it suits the child class.

when we override a parent class method in the child class, while execution the child class method is given preference over the parent class method.

If the child class does not overide the parent class method, then the parent class method will be invoked.

In the child class if the signature of the parent class method is altered( same method name with different arguments), then at the execution time, 
the parent method or the child method that suits the signature is called.

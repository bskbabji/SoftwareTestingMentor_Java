A set does not allow duplicate values where as in a list that is array list we can store duplicate values.

In arraylist , the elements are stored in the order of insertion, where as in a set, the elements are 
unordered. so you cannot access elements based on index. 

because the elements are unordered, we cannot remove the elements by index. but we can remove the elements 
using the actual element itself.

suppose say a hashSet contains (10,20,30,40)

hashset.remove(10); can be done.

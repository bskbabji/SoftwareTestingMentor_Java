Where as an abstract class can have a combination of abstract methods and concrete methods, an interface should have only abstract methods.

an interface can have only abstract methods.

a child class that inherits an interface should implement the interface using implements keyword.

We cannot instantiate objects of an interface because an interface has all abstract methods.

Java allows extending class to any class, but it has a limit. It means a class can extend only a single class at a time. ...
When a class extends a class, then it is called single inheritance . If a class extends more than one class, it is called multi-inheritance(multiple 
inheritance) , which is not allowed in Java


a class cannot extend multiple parent classes but a class can implement multiple interfaces.
 Using interfaces we can acheive multiple inheritance in java.

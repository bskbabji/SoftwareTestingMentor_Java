We need Apache POI to read or write to excel files.
we have to download Apache POI before starting any programming

we need following jar files from apache poi ( these are mandatory)

poi-4.1.2 jar
commons-collections . jar
poi-ooxml. jar
poi-ooxml-scheams.jar
xmlbeans.jar
commons-compress.jar

but we can simply add all the apache poi jar files to the build path of the project before programming. 

An excel file consists of sheets in a workbook, 
Either to read from or write to an excel file, we first need to create the object of XSSFWorkbook class.

XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook();

To create sheets in workbook , we use XSSFSheet class

XSSFSheet sheet1 = workbook.createSheet("name of the sheet");

once we create the sheet we need to create rows.

Row r0 = sheet1.createRow(0);

In rows, we create cells

Cell c0 = r0.createCell(0);

After creating the contents of the workbook, we need to write the workbook to a file.

So we have to create an object of FileOutputStream (FileWriter does not work).
workbook.write(file_object)

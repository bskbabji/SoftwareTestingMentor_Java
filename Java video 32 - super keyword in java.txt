super keyword in java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.
whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is 
referred by super reference variable.

super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.

When parent class and child class has the same variable name, to refer to variable of the parent class, we
use super keyword.

super can be used to immediate parent class method
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor. This will be useful when the parent class 
have parameterized constructor.



java compiler invokes parent class default constructor automatically but not argument constructor.
. when a parent class has parameterized 
constructor, we have to use super() and pass the necessary arguments from the child class constructor.

this keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
When the local variables in class methods and constructors have the same names as that of instance vairables of that class, then to refer to the class 
variables , we can use this.


example: class Test
{
	int x;
	int y;
	publiv void setData(int x, int y)
	  {

		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
	  }
}

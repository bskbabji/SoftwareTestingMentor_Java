what is class - a class is a template or blueprint. employee details like name ,age ,address
what is object - an object is a specific instance of class. like the details of one particular employee.

Employee e = new Employee();  is how an object of the class is created. This statement allocated memory for this object on the java heap.

javaheap is the memory space taken by JVM from the operating system. after using the object, due to automatic garbage collection in java, the memory gets
freed and we can reuse the memory.

The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM. 
Objects in the heap can be shared between threads. Many users restrict the Java heap size to 2-8 GB in order to minimize garbage collection pauses.

Abstraction is the process of hiding details from the end user

we can acheive Abstraction by the use of abstract keyword on 
		classes
		methods or
		interfaces

an abstract method is a method with no definition.
a method with definiton is called a concrete method.

child class which inherits an abstract class should implement the functions of the parent abstract class or 
if the child class does not want to implement any of the methods or all of the methods should declare itself as abstract too.


A class which has atleast one abstract method should be declared abstract, which means an abstract class can have a combination of 
abstract method and concrete method.



Java cannot create Objects of an abstract class.

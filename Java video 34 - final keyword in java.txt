final keyword restricts the user.
final keyword can be used on a variable or a method or on a class.

when we use final keyword on a instance variable you cannnot change its value once initialized.

if a method in a parent class is declred as final, then the child class cannot override the parent class
 method.

But overloading a method in the same class is possible.

if a class is declared as final, then any other class cannot inherit it.
